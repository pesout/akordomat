The End
[D]This is the end, beaut[C]iful friend [D]
This is the end, my only f[C]riend, the end [D]
of our[C] elabora[G]te plans, the e[D]nd
of eve[C]rything that stands, the en[D]d
no safe[C]ty or s[G]urprise,[D] the end
I'll[C] never look into your eyes again[D]

Can you picture[C] what will be, [D]
so li[G7]mitless and free, [D]
de[C]sp'rately in need of[D] some stranger's hand[G], [D]
in a [C]desp'rate land. [D]

[D]Lost in a roman wilderness of pain
and all the children are insane

Waiting for the summer rain
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the king's highway
Weird scenes inside the goldmine
ride the king's highway west, baby
Ride the snake

To the lake,the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long,seven miles
ride the snake,he's old and his skin is cold
The West is the best

Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where you taking us?
